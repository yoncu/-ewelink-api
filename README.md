# ewelink-api
eWeLink for REST API is a API who let you interact with eWeLink API using your regular credentials.

You can create the API ID and API Key information you will use in API access from your membership panel on our Yoncu.Com site. You can access the "Member Operations" > "Menu Continuation" > "Security Settings" > "API Access" panel from the main page of our Yoncu website. From this panel, you must allow the API by adding the IP addresses you can access. If you are going to run and test online on this page, instead of API Key, you can also make transactions with the router membership login without the need to write API information. If you want to operate with API information, you must allow your current internet exit ip address.
